# Bilingualism: Language & Cognition
Bilingual Code Switching in Tweets (Paris & Irma dataset)

**Two large datasets made available**
```
Due to Twitter's restrictions, we are only able to share the tweet ID's
1. **Paris Novemer Attack** - Tweet Id's are available in the paris_dataset folder
2. **Irma Hurricane Dataset** - The files 06.txt to 12.txt contain the tweets ids of the english tweets of hurricane irma collected between Sept 6th 2017 to Sept 12 2017.
```

This repository contains a mixture of codebase written in R (predominantly) and Python.
