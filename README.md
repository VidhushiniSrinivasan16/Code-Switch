# Bilingualism: Language & Cognition
Bilingual Code Switching in Tweets (Paris & Irma dataset)

**Two large datasets made available**
```
Due to Twitter's restrictions, we are only able to share the tweet ID's
1. **Paris Novemer Attack** 
2. **Irma Hurricane Dataset** 
```

This repository contains a mixture of codebase written in R (predominantly) and Python.
